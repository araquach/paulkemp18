            <p>Please check back to our page for updates on our potential opening date. Our booking systems are currently closed too as we canâ€™t guarantee any appointments at the minute.</p>
            <p>If you have appointments already booked in they remain unaffected, if we open before your appointment you will keep this appointment. We will be contacting everyone who has missed an appointment due to the salon being closed to arrange this for your earliest convenience - again once we have a better idea of when we'll be reopening.</p>
            <p>We hope you are all staying safe and well. For all the key workers out there, keep up the amazing work youâ€™re doing ðŸ™Œ We canâ€™t wait to be back at it making you all look and feel fresh again ðŸ˜Š</p>
